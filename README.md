### Topic of choice
For this project I will choose the topic Computer Vision - Image classification.
### Project type
The project type I want to choose is "Bring your own method"
### Project description
My project consists of usind Deep Learning to classify images of brain tumors. My ideas so far (from the literature review I've done) is to try and use methods like Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for this approach, and try to get an accuracy as high as possible for the dataset I will be working on.
### Dataset description
I have searched for multiple datasets, and they usually consist of images having 4 possible classes, corresponding to the kind of tumor present, or no tumor if the patient is healthy. The dataset I like the most and will use for my experiments contains 3275 such images, having different resolutions, which is already a challenge for the preprocessing step.
### Work-breakdown structure
My indended planning looks like this:
* dataset collection and preprocessing - 2 days
* designing and building an appropriate network - 3 days
* training and fine-tuning that network - 8 days
* building an application to present the results -  3 days
* writing the final report - 1 day
* preparing the presentation of your work 1 day
